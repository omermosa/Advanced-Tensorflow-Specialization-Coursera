# Advanced-Tensorflow-Specialization-Coursera

This repo has my solutions to the programming assignments of Coursera's Advanced Tensorflow Techniques Specialization. The first course talks about Custom Models, Layers, Loss functions, and Callbacks in Tf.Keras.

The second Course talks about Distributed Training and Custom Training Loops.

The third Course talks about Advanced Tensorflow for Computer Vision (Transfer Learning and fine-tuning, Object detection, Segmentation, Interpretability and Visualization).

The fourth Course introduces several Generative Models including Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders and GANs. It also introduces the neural style transfer.
